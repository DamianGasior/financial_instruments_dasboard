 # About the Author
    
I have over 15 years of experience in finance, banking, and capital markets.
Since mid-2018, I have been working in IT, initially as a Business Analyst and currently as a Product Manager.

In recent years, I have been expanding my technical skill set, focusing on Python development and gradually moving toward data analysis and AI/ML-related topics.
This project was created as a hands-on, educational initiative to better understand the technical aspects of financial data processing, analytics implementation, and the developer’s perspective on building data-driven applications.
